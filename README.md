# Gender Pay Analysis – Glassdoor

This project explores gender-based salary disparities using real-world data from Glassdoor. It aims to determine whether statistically significant wage differences exist between men and women, and what factors may contribute to these gaps.



## Project Goals

* Assess whether a gender pay gap exists in the dataset
* Identify patterns by industry, job title, and location
* Quantify pay differences using statistical methods
* Visualize insights to support understanding
* Recommend actions for promoting pay equity



## Dataset Overview

* Source: Glassdoor salary dataset ([from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nilimajauhari/glassdoor-analyze-gender-pay-gap))
* Scope: Includes job titles, gender, salary, location, experience level, and employer reviews
* Focus: Binary gender comparison (male and female)



## Methods Used

* Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, formatting salary ranges, removing outliers
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions and relationships
* Statistical Testing:

  * Welch’s t-test (comparing group means with unequal variances)
  * Cohen’s d (measuring effect size)
  * ANOVA (for comparing across multiple categories)
  * Linear Regression (to account for factors like experience and location)



## Key Insights

* Statistically significant pay gaps were identified in several sectors, including tech and finance
* Women were less represented in higher-paying job roles
* Even modest gaps, when consistent, can have long-term financial impact
* Some employers displayed better equity practices based on compensation patterns and reviews



## Visualizations

* Histograms and boxplots comparing salary distributions by gender
* Role-wise breakdowns with annotation of statistical outcomes
* Regression plots with interpretation of coefficients
